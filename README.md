# Samurai Style Cop 2
- Have a massive legacy codebase that has no styling standards?  
- Want to add a code style standard without bulk reformatting tons of code that can cause mass merge conflicts and headache downstream?  
- Want to lint check newly committed code only?  
- Use git as your version control system?

If you said **'yes'** to at least the last one, then enter the `Samurai Style Cop`.  

A checkstyle-based tool that can generate exclusions based on git history so that only the code you stage for commit is checked for styling and quality metrics.  

[All other lines of code are considered death merchants who distribute drugs to our children through schools and on the streets and before they pass through the analyzer their stinking lines will be in garbage bags and ship them back to their maker for fertilizer. Got it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0IBhUoPlfM)

## Why 2?
I wrote a similar tool before that I'm not at liberty to share the code nor do I possess it, so this is a clean room rewrite.

## This looks incomplete?
Sure is, not in working order yet.
